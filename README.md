# Orinoco Lite site

This is an Orinoco Lite metadata-driven website.
Set its public identity in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.orinoco.site]`.
The starter records build immediately; replace them with your own metadata to populate the site.
Custom pages and layouts are optional.

```console
pixi run build
pixi run serve
```

The source boundary is:

- `site-specific/metadata/` — semantic records and curation annotations;
- `site-specific/content/` — editorial Markdown;
- `site-specific/assets/` and `site-specific/static/` — declared website data;
- `pyproject.toml` — runtime settings, with public identity, navigation, and appearance under `[tool.orinoco.site]`;
- `site-specific/overrides/` — explicit declarative config, layout, or static overrides; and
- `extensions/` — optional metadata acquisition and curation executables that never ship with or execute during the website build.

See [getting started](docs/getting-started.md), [ownership](docs/ownership.md), and [custom-domain setup](docs/custom-domain.md). Pull requests also get a disposable Netlify rendering; see [pull-request previews](docs/pr-previews.md).

Package versions are selected through Pixi and template versions through `.copier-answers.yml`.
See [template updates](docs/template-updates.md) for the supported update commands.
