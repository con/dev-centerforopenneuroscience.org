# Orinoco Lite site

This is an Orinoco Lite metadata-driven website.
Set its public identity in `site-specific/site.yaml`.
The starter records and `/explore` page build and preview immediately; replace them with reviewed site metadata and editorial content before publishing.
Orinoco Lite resolves its pinned upstream presentation and composes it with this scaffold's small `.orinoco-lite/presentation/` adapter, its bounded `.orinoco-lite/materialized-presentation/upstream/` asset overlay, and the repository's declarative `site-specific/` inputs.

```console
pixi run validate
pixi run build
pixi run serve
```

The source boundary is:

- `site-specific/metadata/` — semantic records and curation annotations;
- `site-specific/content/` — editorial Markdown;
- `site-specific/assets/` and `site-specific/static/` — declared website data;
- `site-specific/site.yaml` — identity, navigation, and supported presentation choices;
- `site-specific/overrides/` — explicit declarative config, layout, or static overrides; and
- `extensions/` — optional metadata acquisition and curation executables that never ship with or execute during the website build.

See [getting started](docs/getting-started.md), [ownership](docs/ownership.md), and [custom-domain setup](docs/custom-domain.md).

`site-specific/` is an unsquashed subtree of [`ORINOCO-Lite/con-site-specific`](https://github.com/ORINOCO-Lite/con-site-specific).
Website changes are reviewed here, while the focused repository distributes accepted subtree history to other projections.
See [ownership](docs/ownership.md#site-specific-subtree) for the commit boundary and synchronization policy.

The released package is the single authority for the upstream website and theme pins.
The downstream selects its package, template, and workflow releases exactly in `orinoco.lock` and `.copier-answers.yml`.
Resources and specifications required to build or operate Orinoco Lite are internal to the package and share its version and integrity boundary.
